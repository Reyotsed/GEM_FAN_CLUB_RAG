When I call for someone but no one’s listening
When the silence is louder than it’s ever been
When the air in my chest feels like it’s paper thin
When I’m one shot away from almost giving in
I will not fall I will not break
Whatever it takes
Cause I’m still breathing
If I got air in my lungs
Then I won’t give up
Cause I’m still breathing
Cause I’m still breathing
Cause I’m still breathing
When I stand in a crowd but i still feel alone
When there’s chaos around me like a war zone
When I’ve lost all I love and all I’ve ever known
When I’m one shot away from almost letting go
I will not fall I will not break
Whatever it takes
Cause I’m still breathing
If I got air in my lungs
Then I won’t give up
Cause I’m still breathing
I will not fall I will not break
Whatever it takes
Cause I’m still breathing
I will not fall I will not break
Whatever it takes
Cause I’m still breathing
Cause I’m still breathing
I will not fall I will not break
Whatever it takes
Cause I’m still breathing
If I got air in my lungs
Then I won’t give up
Cause I’m still breathing
（I will not fall I will not break）
（Whatever it takes）
Cause I’m still breathing
（I will not fall I will not break）
（Whatever it takes）
Cause I’m still breathing
